# Deployment

This document outlines the deployment strategy for the Loan Management Module (LMS) and the Middleware. We will focus on deploying to Fly.io, using an H2 in-memory database for simplicity. **Note:** This setup is for demonstration purposes only. Data will NOT persist when the application restarts.

## 1. Deployment Options

* **Local Deployment:** Deploying the applications directly to a local machine for development and testing.
* **Virtual Machine (VM) Deployment:** Deploying the applications to virtual machines in a cloud environment (e.g., AWS EC2, Azure VMs, Google Compute Engine).
* **Containerized Deployment (Recommended):** Deploying the applications as Docker containers to a container orchestration platform like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm. This provides scalability, portability, and isolation.
* **Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) Deployment:** Deploying the applications to a PaaS platform like Heroku or AWS Elastic Beanstalk. This simplifies the deployment process and provides automatic scaling and management.
* **Fly.io (Recommended):** A modern platform for deploying and scaling applications globally. Fly.io uses lightweight VMs (Firecracker) and makes deployment easy with its CLI.

## 2. Recommended Approach: Deployment to Fly.io

Fly.io is a great option for deploying the LMS and Middleware. It's relatively simple to use, provides global distribution, and has a free tier. **This guide assumes you are using an H2 in-memory database for simplicity. Remember data will NOT persist on restarts!**

### 2.1. Prerequisites

1. **Fly.io Account:** Create an account at [https://fly.io/](https://fly.io/).
2. **Flyctl CLI:** Install the Flyctl command-line tool. Follow the instructions on the Fly.io website for your operating system.
3. **Docker:** Ensure Docker is installed and running locally. Fly.io uses Docker images for deployment.

### 2.2. Dockerizing the Applications

1. **Create a `Dockerfile` for each application (LMS and Middleware):**

   * **Example `Dockerfile` (LMS):**

   ```dockerfile
   FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jre-jammy

   # Add Maintainer Info
   LABEL maintainer="youremail@example.com"

   # Set the working directory
   WORKDIR /app

   # Copy the JAR file into the container
   COPY target/lms-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar app.jar

   # Expose the port the app runs on
   EXPOSE 8080

   # Define the command to run the application
   ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
   ```

   * **Example `Dockerfile` (Middleware):**

   ```dockerfile
   FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jre-jammy

   # Add Maintainer Info
   LABEL maintainer="youremail@example.com"

   # Set the working directory
   WORKDIR /app

   # Copy the JAR file into the container
   COPY target/middleware-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar app.jar

   # Expose the port the app runs on
   EXPOSE 8081

   # Define the command to run the application
   ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
   ```

2. **Build the JAR files using Maven:**

   ```bash
   mvn clean install  # In both the LMS and Middleware project directories
   ```

3. **Build the docker images:**

   ```bash
   docker build -t lms-image .  # From the LMS project directory
   docker build -t middleware-image . # From the Middleware project directory
   ```

4. **(Optional) Push the Docker images to a container registry:**

   This step is optional. Fly.io can build the image directly from your Dockerfile. If you skip this, remove the `image:` lines from the fly.toml file below.

   ```bash
   docker tag lms-image your-dockerhub-username/lms-image:latest
   docker push your-dockerhub-username/lms-image:latest

   docker tag middleware-image your-dockerhub-username/middleware-image:latest
   docker push your-dockerhub-username/middleware-image:latest
   ```

### 2.3. Fly.io Deployment

1. **Create a fly.toml file for each application (LMS and Middleware):**

   This file configures your Fly.io application.

   * **Example `fly.toml` (LMS):**

   ```toml
   app = "lms-app"  # Replace with your desired app name (must be unique on Fly.io)
   primary_region = "iad"  # Choose a region close to your users

   [build]
     dockerfile = "Dockerfile"

   [http_service]
     internal_port = 8080
     force_https = true
     auto_stop_machines = true
     auto_start_machines = true
     min_machines_running = 1

   [[vm]]
     cpu_kind = "shared"
     cpus = 1
     memory_mb = 512

   [env]
     # Spring profile to use (optional, if you have a specific profile for H2)
     SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE = "h2"
     # Since we're using H2 in-memory, we don't need database credentials
   ```

   * **Example `fly.toml` (Middleware):**

   ```toml
   app = "middleware-app"  # Replace with your desired app name (must be unique on Fly.io)
   primary_region = "iad"  # Choose a region close to your users

   [build]
     dockerfile = "Dockerfile"

   [http_service]
     internal_port = 8081
     force_https = true
     auto_stop_machines = true
     auto_start_machines = true
     min_machines_running = 1

   [[vm]]
     cpu_kind = "shared"
     cpus = 1
     memory_mb = 512
   ```

2. **Configure H2 Profile (LMS):**

   In your application.properties or application.yml file for the LMS project, create a profile for H2:

   ```properties
   # application-h2.properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
   spring.datasource.driverClassName=org.h2.Driver
   spring.datasource.username=sa
   spring.datasource.password=
   spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect
   spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
   ```

   Then activate that profile on Fly.io using environment variables.

3. **Deploy the applications using the Flyctl CLI:**

   ```bash
   flyctl launch --no-deploy # Run flyctl launch to create the fly.toml, but skip deployment
   # Edit the fly.toml file to add your env variables

   flyctl deploy # In both the LMS and Middleware project directories
   ```

   * The `flyctl deploy` command will:
     * Build the Docker image (if you didn't push it to a registry).
     * Deploy the application to the Fly.io platform.

   Make sure your application is active with the h2 profile.

## 3. Database Configuration (H2 - IN-MEMORY - NOT PERSISTENT!)

**IMPORTANT:** With H2 in-memory, you do not need to create a database on Fly.io. The database will be created automatically when the application starts, but it will be empty each time the application restarts.

You can create a profile for H2 as shown in section 2.3.

## 4. Post-Deployment Steps

1. **Check Application Logs:**

   Use `flyctl logs -a <app-name>` to view the application logs and check for any errors.

2. **Scale the Applications:**

   Use `flyctl scale count <number>` to scale the number of instances of your applications as needed.

3. **Monitor the Applications:**

   Use Fly.io's monitoring tools to track the performance and health of your applications.

## 5. Notes

* Replace placeholders like `lms-app` and `middleware-app` with your actual app names.
* Choose a Fly.io region that is close to your users for low latency.
* **REMEMBER: Data will be lost when the application restarts! This is only suitable for demonstration purposes!**
* For persistent data, you must use a real database (like Fly.io's PostgreSQL add-on or an external database) and configure the appropriate environment variables.

## Key Changes

* **H2 Focus:** The document now emphasizes the use of H2 in-memory for simplicity.
* **Persistence Warning:** A prominent warning is added about the lack of data persistence with H2 in-memory.
* **Simplified `fly.toml`:** The `fly.toml` files are simplified, removing database credentials and adding a `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` environment variable to activate the H2 profile.
* Added configuration for the H2 profile.
* **Database Configuration Section:** The database configuration section is updated to reflect the use of H2 in-memory and the fact that no database creation is needed on Fly.io.

## Your Tasks

1. **Follow the instructions to deploy to Fly.io, but be aware of the limitations of using H2 in-memory.** Only use this for testing the deployment process itself.
2. **For a real application, you *must* switch to a persistent database like PostgreSQL.**
