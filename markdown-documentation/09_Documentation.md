# Documentation

This document outlines the documentation for the Loan Management Module (LMS) and the Middleware.

## 1. API Documentation

* **Swagger/OpenAPI:**
  * Generate Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for the LMS REST APIs using the `springdoc-openapi-starter-webmvc-ui` dependency.
  * Access the Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html` (or the deployed URL of your LMS application).
  * The Swagger documentation should include:
    * API endpoints
    * Request and response formats
    * Authentication and authorization requirements
    * Example requests and responses
* **Postman Collection (Optional):**
  * Create a Postman collection with example requests for each API endpoint. This can be helpful for developers who want to quickly test the APIs.

## 2. README File

Create a `README.md` file in each project directory (LMS and Middleware) with the following information:

* **Project Title:** A descriptive title for the project (e.g., "Loan Management System", "Middleware for Transactional Data").
* **Description:** A brief description of the project and its purpose.
* **Requirements:**
  * Java 17 (or your chosen version)
  * Maven
  * PostgreSQL (LMS only)
* **Setup Instructions:**
  * Clone the repository.
  * Build the project using Maven: `mvn clean install`
  * Configure the database connection (LMS only) in `application.properties` or `application.yml`.
  * Run the application: `mvn spring-boot:run`
* **API Endpoints:** (A summary of the key API endpoints)
  * LMS: `/subscriptions`, `/loans`, `/loans/{loanId}`, `/scoring/callback`
  * Middleware: `/transactions/{customerNumber}`
* **Authentication:** Describe the authentication mechanisms used for each API (API Key, OAuth 2.0, Basic Authentication).
* **Deployment Instructions:** A summary of the deployment steps (Docker, Kubernetes, PaaS).
* **License:** (Optional) Specify the license for the project.

## 3. Code Comments

* Add comments to your code to explain complex logic, algorithms, and design decisions.
* Follow JavaDoc conventions for documenting classes, methods, and fields.

## 4. Diagrams (Optional)

* Include diagrams to visualize the system architecture, data flow, and component interactions. You can use tools like draw.io or Lucidchart to create diagrams.

## 5. Contributing Guidelines (Optional)

* If you plan to collaborate with other developers, create contributing guidelines to ensure code quality and consistency.

## Key Improvements and Considerations

* **Comprehensive Deployment Options:** Covers various deployment options from local to containerized.
* **Docker and Kubernetes Instructions:** Provides detailed instructions for Dockerizing the applications and deploying them to Kubernetes.
* **CI/CD Pipeline:** Emphasizes the importance of setting up a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment.
* **Documentation Checklist:** Outlines the key elements of API documentation, README files, and code comments.

## Your Tasks

* Choose a deployment option.
* Create Dockerfiles for the LMS and Middleware.
* Build Docker images and push them to a container registry (if using Docker).
* Create Kubernetes deployment and service definitions (if using Kubernetes).
* Set up a CI/CD pipeline (optional, but highly recommended).
* Generate Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for the LMS APIs.
* Create a README.md file for each project.
* Add code comments to your code.
